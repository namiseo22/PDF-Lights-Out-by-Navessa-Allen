And yes, I know I?m responsible for what the algorithm shows me, but I?m trying to ignore that fact.Lately, my feed has been dominated by masked men. I?ve favorited videos with them dressed in full cosplay, decked out in futuristic military apparel, and wrapped up like ghouls.But more than anything else, my FYP is filled with shirtless men wearing ghost masks. Bonus points if they?re heavily tattooed, wielding a knife, or covered in fake blood. At night, I dream about being chased by them, of them catching me and doing deliciously dark things to my more than willing body.I never could have guessed that by sending one drunken text, those dreams would become my new reality.Lights Out is a fast-paced dark romance with a morally grey male lead. Some themes and scenes may be disturbing to </p>
